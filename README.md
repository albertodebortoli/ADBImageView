# ADBImageView

ADBImageView inherits from UIImageView and allow asynchronous image loading from the cloud using NSURLConnectionDelegate protocol built-in Cocoa. 
It shows up a placeholder image and an activity indicator during the loading. It provides gesture for single tap and long press.
It also provides caching functionalities taken from Toto Tvalavadze's [TCImageView](https://github.com/totocaster/TCImageView).

Try out the included demo project.

Simple usage:

- copy ADBImageView class into your project
- import `ADBImageView.h` in your class
- use as follow

``` objective-c
ADBImageView *imageView = [[ADBImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 128.0, 128.0)];
imageView.delegate = self;
    
[imageView setImageWithURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.albertodebortoli.it/GitHub/ADBImageView/H-Farm.jpg"]
          placeholderImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"placeholder.png"]];
```

- to load another image on the same object use

``` objective-c
[imageView reloadWithUrl:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://www.albertodebortoli.it/GitHub/ADBImageView/H-umus.jpg"]];
```

- use delegation pattern implementing ADBImageViewDelegate protocol and related optional delegate methods

``` objective-c
#pragma mark - ADBImageViewDelegate
- (void)ADBImageView:(ADBImageView *)view willUpdateImage:(UIImage *)image { ... }
- (void)ADBImageView:(ADBImageView *)view didLoadImage:(UIImage *)image { ... }
- (void)ADBImageView:(ADBImageView *)view failedLoadingWithError:(NSError *)error { ... }
- (void)ADBImageViewDidSingleTap:(ADBImageView *)view { ... }
- (void)ADBImageViewDidLongPress:(ADBImageView *)view { ... }
```
